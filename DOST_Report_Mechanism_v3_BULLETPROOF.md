# DOST IMPACT-NXT Quarterly Narrative Report — Generation Mechanism (v3 BULLETPROOF)

---

## ⛔ ABSOLUTE RULES — AI MUST OBEY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

1. **THE REPORT HAS EXACTLY 3 CHAPTERS.** Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3. NEVER create Chapter 4, 5, or any additional chapter. This is non-negotiable.
2. **THE REPORT HAS EXACTLY 6 TOP-LEVEL SECTIONS** in this order: Cover Page → Table of Contents → Executive Summary → Chapter 1 → Chapter 2 → Chapter 3 → Annex Section. No more, no less.
3. **ALL detailed accomplishments go ONLY inside Chapter 2** as numbered subsections (§2.1, §2.2, §2.3, ... as many as needed). NEVER create new chapters for more content.
4. **Chapter 3 is ONLY for assessment + next steps.** It is short (1–2 pages). NEVER put accomplishment details here.
5. **Follow the exact paragraph templates below.** Every paragraph in the report matches a template. Do not freestyle.
6. **Do not invent new sections** such as "Conclusions," "Methodology" (as standalone chapter), "Recommendations" (as standalone chapter), "Discussion," "Summary," or "References."
7. **Match the EXACT formatting, heading styles, bullet styles, table styles, and caption styles** described below.

## PHASE 0: DATA EXTRACTION FROM TASK MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD

### 0.1 What to Extract from Each Task

| Dashboard Field | What to Pull | Where It Goes in the Report |
|---|---|---|
| **Task Name / Title** | Main task name | Table 1 accomplishment bullets (Ch.1) + Section/subsection titles in Ch.2 |
| **Task Description** | Full description text | "Activity Description" paragraphs in Ch.2 subsections |
| **Status** | Completed / In Progress / Deferred / Not Started | Determines which report bucket (see §0.2) |
| **Subtasks + Their Statuses** | Each subtask name, status, completion | Granular bullets in Table 1 + detailed narrative in Ch.2 |
| **Updates / Comments / Activity Log** | All progress notes posted by team members over time | **RICHEST SOURCE** — provides the journey, pivots, decisions, and challenges. Use for Ch.2 context openers, significance closers, and challenge narratives |
| **URL / Evidence Field** | Links to deliverables (docs, forms, dashboards, publications) | AI should READ these links to understand what was actually produced. Enables substantive writing. Becomes Annex references or inline citations |
| **Due Date / Completion Date** | Planned vs actual dates | Timeline adherence info for Ch.3 assessment |
| **Priority / Weight** | Priority level or % weight | Maps to DOST percentage weights in Table 1 |
| **Tags / Categories** | Organizational labels | Used to GROUP tasks into Ch.2 sections |
| **Attachments** | Files attached to tasks | Potential Annex materials |

### 0.2 Processing Steps

**Step 1 — Filter:** Only include tasks with activity during the reporting quarter date range.

**Step 2 — Classify into buckets:**

| Task Status | Report Bucket |
|---|---|
| Completed | Full accomplishment → Table 1 bullets + Ch.2 subsection |
| In Progress (significant work done) | Partial accomplishment → Table 1 with "Ongoing" qualifier + Ch.2 subsection |
| In Progress (barely started) | Brief mention in Table 1 + noted in §3.2 as upcoming |
| Deferred / Blocked | Table 1 with reason + §3.2 with explanation |
| Not Started | §3.2 only. NOT in Table 1 or Ch.2 |

**Step 3 — Group by tags/categories** into logical work streams → these become §2.1, §2.2, §2.3, etc.

**Step 4 — Evidence deep-dive:** Visit each URL to understand the actual deliverable. Extract metrics, scope, quality details.

**Step 5 — Reconstruct story:** From update logs, identify chronology, pivots, challenges, and decisions for each work stream.

### 0.3 Supplementary User Inputs (ask user for these)

| Input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Quarter number + exact date range | Title page, headers, temporal references |
| Month of submission | Title page footer |
| Accomplishments NOT in the dashboard | Off-tool work: meetings, informal agreements, strategic decisions |
| Challenges/deviations not captured in updates | High-level strategic challenges |
| Planned activities for NEXT quarter | §3.2 content |
| Key events/conferences held | May warrant dedicated §2.X section |
| New partnerships/MOUs | Strategic credibility content |
| Stakeholder quotes | Rhetorical anchoring for event sections |
| Status of Form 6 and Form 8 | Cross-references |
| Annexes to include | Annex section |

---

## PHASE 4: CHAPTER 1 — EXACT PARAGRAPH-BY-PARAGRAPH TEMPLATE

### Chapter Heading Format
```
Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview of Accomplishments
```
**Rule:** The heading text is ALWAYS exactly this. It never changes between quarters.

### Paragraph 1: Project Identity Block (FIXED — nearly identical every quarter)

**EXACT TEXT (copy this, only change the bridging sentence at the end):**
```
The IMPACT-NXT Project is a major national initiative focused on strengthening technology 
transfer capacity in Philippine Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Research and 
Development Institutes (RDIs). The project responds to persistent gaps in TTO structure, 
capability, and professionalization, and aims to deliver:

   ● A contextualized Competency Framework for TTO personnel
   ● A Training Needs Analysis (TNA) tool tailored to local conditions
   ● A full competency assessment of 34 universities and RDIs
   ● Three competency development plans and training roadmaps (Basic, Responsive, 
     Progressive TTOs)
   ● A Policy Proposal for sustaining skills development and professionalizing TTO roles
```

**Rules:**
- This paragraph + bullet list is a FIXED BLOCK. Copy it verbatim every quarter.
- The 5-item bullet list NEVER changes — these are the fixed project deliverables.
- This is the ONLY place in Chapter 1 where bullets are used.

### Paragraph 2: Bridging Sentence (changes each quarter)

**Template:**
```
This [ordinal] quarter [brief thematic phrase about what the quarter focused on].
```

**Actual Q1 example:**
> "This first quarter laid the foundations for these outputs."

### Section 1.1: Project Objectives

**Section heading:** `1.1 Project Objectives`

**Introductory sentence (exactly 1 sentence):**

**Template:**
```
The accomplishments during this quarter directly support the following project objectives:
```

**Rule:** This sentence is FIXED. Use it verbatim every quarter. It is immediately followed by Table 1.

### Table 1: Summary of Accomplishments this Quarter

**Table title (always placed ABOVE the table, centered):**
```
Table 1. Summary of Accomplishments this Quarter
```

**Table structure — EXACTLY 3 columns:**

| Column Header | Content Rules |
|---|---|
| `OBJECTIVES` | The project's fixed objectives. These NEVER change between quarters. The two primary objectives are: (1) "Customize the Competency Framework for Philippine TTOs" and (2) "Implementing a Competency Assessment (which includes Training Needs Analysis) based on the proposed competency framework for the IMPACT university TTOs (20%)" |
| `TARGET ACTIVITIES` | Planned activities for THIS quarter. Use bullet points (●) inside the cell. Include DOST percentage weights in parentheses where assigned: "(5%)", "(15%)", "(4%)". Include sub-items indented with dashes: "- PH innovation agenda" |
| `[Nth] QUARTER ACCOMPLISHMENTS` | Actual accomplishments as bullet points (●). Each bullet starts with a past-tense action verb: "Completed...", "Conducted...", "Secured...", "Drafted...", "Organized...", "Finalized...", "Studied...", "Collected..." |

**Special rows:**
- If an activity was deferred, include it as a bullet in the ACCOMPLISHMENTS column with the deferral reason: "● Selection of candidates was pushed to a later quarter (after [prerequisite])..."
- If there are extra accomplishments beyond the planned objectives, add an "Other/Extra Accomplishments:" label at the bottom of the ACCOMPLISHMENTS column (NOT a new table row — it appears inside the last cell)

### Section 1.2: Financial Status

**Section heading:** `1.2 Financial Status`

**Content (exactly 1 line — NEVER elaborate):**
```
[Refer to attached Form 8]
```

---

## PHASE 5: CHAPTER 2 — EXACT PARAGRAPH-BY-PARAGRAPH TEMPLATE

### Chapter Heading Format
```
Chapter 2: Detailed [Nth] Quarter Activities and Accomplishments
```
**Rule:** Replace `[Nth]` with the quarter ordinal (First, Second, Third, Fourth). Everything else is fixed.

### How to Structure Chapter 2

**Step 1:** Take the grouped work streams from Phase 0, Step 3. Each work stream becomes a §2.X section.

**Step 2:** Within each work stream, individual activities/deliverables become §2.X.Y subsections.

**Step 3:** Standalone high-impact accomplishments (events, conferences, major outputs) get their own §2.X section without subsections.

**Numbering example for a quarter with 4 work streams:**
```
2.1 [Work Stream A Title]
  2.1.1 [Activity 1]
  2.1.2 [Activity 2]
2.2 [Work Stream B Title]
  2.2.1 [Sub-activity 1]
  2.2.2 [Sub-activity 2]
  2.2.3 [Sub-activity 3]
  2.2.4 [Sub-activity 4]
2.3 [Work Stream C — standalone activity]
2.4 [Work Stream D — standalone activity, e.g., a conference]
```

### Section Title Rules

- §2.X titles use **descriptive noun phrases**: "Methodology Development", "Foundational Work based on the Finalized Methodology", "Formulation of Assessor Selection Criteria", "First IMPACT Local Conference"
- §2.X.Y titles use **descriptive noun phrases with colons when clarifying**: "Top-Down Anchoring: Clarifying Philippine TT Purpose & Context", "Completion of Desk Research", "Situationer Survey Instrument Development and Piloting"
- NEVER use action verbs in titles: NOT "Developing the Methodology" or "How We Conducted Research"

### §2.X Sections That Have Subsections — Opening Paragraph Pattern

When a §2.X section has subsections (§2.X.1, §2.X.2...), it opens with a brief 1-2 sentence **framing paragraph** before the first subsection.

**Template:**
```
[Brief statement of what this work stream encompassed and its relationship to the project methodology]. 
[Optional second sentence listing the components].
```

**Actual Q1 examples:**

For §2.1 (Methodology Development) — the framing exists within §2.1.1 itself.

For §2.2 (Foundational Work):
> "This foundational work corresponds to the execution of the initial methodological steps, encompassing top-down contextual anchoring, targeted desk research, and the iterative development of a 'bottom-up' situationer tool."

### §2.X.Y Subsection Writing — THE 4-PART MICRO-STRUCTURE

**Every subsection in Chapter 2 follows this exact 4-part structure. This is the core writing engine.**

---

#### PART 1: Context Opener (1-2 sentences)

Establishes WHY this activity was needed and connects it to previous work or methodology.

**Sentence Templates (use one):**

| Template | When to Use |
|---|---|
| "Following the completion of [previous activity], the project team [developed/proceeded with/undertook] [this activity]..." | When this activity directly follows another |
| "Building on the established [methodological direction/findings/output] of [previous work], the team undertook [this activity]..." | When this activity builds on prior outputs |
| "Parallel to the [other concurrent work stream], the project team [drafted/developed/initiated] [this activity]..." | When this activity ran alongside another |
| "The development of [output] began with [foundational step]..." | When describing the starting point of a major deliverable |
| "The [ordinal] quarter covered a critical [review/analysis/assessment] of [topic]..." | When opening a major review/analysis section |
| "A major accomplishment in this ([ordinal]) quarter, which was originally planned for the [other] quarter was [activity]..." | When reporting an activity pulled forward from a later quarter |

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS connect to something (previous work, methodology, concurrent activity, or project rationale)
- NEVER start a subsection with the activity itself — always provide context first

---

#### PART 2: Activity Description (2-6 sentences, may include bullets or tables)

Describes WHAT was specifically done. This is the substantive core.

**Writing patterns observed:**

**Pattern A — Prose with specifics:**
```
[What the team did, with specific details]. [How it was done / what approach was used]. 
[Scope or scale of the work]. [Design principles or guiding criteria if applicable].
```

Example (§2.2.3):
> "In total, four versions of the draft survey instrument were developed and piloted. These iterations reflected both the project's initial design assumptions and subsequent refinements based on pilot feedback."

**Pattern B — Prose followed by a bullet list:**
Used when listing specific items covered, principles followed, or areas assessed.

```
[Introductory sentence ending with a colon]:

   ● [Item 1]
   ● [Item 2]
   ● [Item 3]
   ● [Item 4]
   ● [Item 5]
```

Example (§2.2.1):
> "Specifically, the team aligned the framework development with the following:
>    ● National innovation objectives (DOST, IPOPHL, CHED, NEDA)
>    ● RA10055 requirements
>    ● Existing constraints and mandates for publicly funded research..."

**Pattern C — Prose followed by a reference table:**
Used when comparing methodologies, frameworks, or presenting structured data.

```
[Introductory prose explaining what was examined and why]

   Table N. [Descriptive Title]
   Source: [Source citation]
   
   [Subtitle describing the table structure, e.g., "Five-Step Development Process:"]
   
   | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

**Table formatting rules:**
- Table title goes ABOVE the table, in bold
- Source citation goes directly below the title, before the table
- A structural subtitle (e.g., "Five-Step Development Process:") may appear between source and table
- Table numbering is sequential across the ENTIRE document (Table 1 is always in §1.1, subsequent tables continue from there)
- Tables in §2.X.Y subsections typically have 4 columns

**Pattern D — Narrative with embedded quotes (for events/conferences):**
```
[Description of the event — when, where, who attended, what happened]. 
[Notable quote from a key stakeholder with attribution]: "[exact quote]"—[context of impact].
[Description of key milestones within the event].
```

Example (§2.4):
> "In his keynote, DOST Secretary Renato U. Solidum, Jr. underscored the importance of research translation, asking, 'What good is a breakthrough if it never breaks through?'—a message that resonated throughout sessions..."

---

#### PART 3: Evidence / Metrics (1-3 sentences OR a metrics table, may be absent for qualitative activities)

Provides quantitative or qualitative evidence of completion/quality.

**When to include:** Whenever the activity produced measurable outputs (survey responses, institutional coverage, response rates, number of iterations, etc.)

**When to omit:** For purely qualitative activities (desk research, methodology adoption, framework design decisions). In these cases, skip directly to Part 4.

**Metric Reporting Patterns:**

**Pattern A — Inline metrics:**
```
As of the reporting period, [metric description]. A total of [X] out of [Y] [units] ([Z]%) 
[achieved/submitted/completed] [what], yielding [specific number] [outputs] against a target 
of [target number] ([achievement %]).
```

Example:
> "A total of 30 out of 34 target institutions (88%) submitted responses, yielding 83 completed survey responses against a target of 90 (92% achievement)."

**Pattern B — Breakdown by category:**
```
[Coverage/Completion] across [categories] was likewise [assessment]. [Responses/Outputs] 
were received from [X] of [Y] [Category A] ([Z]%), [X] of [Y] [Category B] ([Z]%), and 
[X] of [Y] [Category C] ([Z]%). While [lowest category] remains comparatively lower, the 
[outputs] received nevertheless provide meaningful representation of [context] and will be 
supplemented, where necessary, through [future activities].
```

Example:
> "Responses were received from 15 of 16 SUCs (94%), 11 of 12 HEIs (92%), and 4 of 6 RDIs (67%). While RDI participation remains comparatively lower, the responses received nevertheless provide meaningful representation of RDI-specific technology transfer contexts and will be supplemented, where necessary, through subsequent validation activities such as KIIs and FGDs."

**Pattern C — Metrics summary table:**
```
   Table N. [Title] (as of [date])
   
   | Metric | Target | Actual | % Achievement |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | [Metric 1] | [value] | [value] | [%] |
   | [Metric 2] | [value] | [value] | [%] |
```

**Metric table rules:**
- ALWAYS include: Metric name, Target, Actual, % Achievement columns
- Always state "as of [date]" in the table title
- Precede with: "The table below summarizes the key [participation/coverage/completion] metrics..."
- May be followed by a figure reference: "...followed by a [timeline/chart] illustrating [what]."

---

#### PART 4: Significance Closer (1-2 sentences)

States the downstream value or implication of the work completed.

**Sentence Templates (use one):**

| Template | When to Use |
|---|---|
| "This [activity/output] provided a [common evidence base/macro-policy lens/foundation] for subsequent [next activities], ensuring [quality/alignment claim]." | When the work feeds into future project phases |
| "Overall, the [deployment/results/output] demonstrate[s] strong [institutional engagement/methodological rigor/alignment] and readiness for subsequent [next phase] stages." | When closing a major deliverable section |
| "This approach ensures that [the output] will possess both [quality 1] and [quality 2]." | When emphasizing the design quality of a deliverable |
| "Overall, the [finalized/completed] [output] prioritizes [value 1], [value 2], and [value 3], ensuring that the resulting [deliverable] is [quality claim]." | When closing a methodology section |
| "Overall, however, the [activity] was deemed to be a success. We have also published a [related output] (refer to Annex [X])." | When closing an event/conference section |
| "Based on these results, the [output] was finalized and is currently being [deployed/implemented] across [scope]." | When closing a piloting/testing section |
| "Overall, the [event] served as a strong launchpad for the project's [quarter]-quarter objectives, generating momentum for [future activities] while demonstrating [collective achievement]." | When closing an event section with strategic significance |

**Rules:**
- The significance closer ALWAYS starts with a transition phrase: "Overall,", "This [noun]...", "Based on these results,"
- It ALWAYS connects backward (what was done) to forward (what it enables)
- Bold the opening phrase "Overall," when used (as observed in the Q1 report pattern)

---

### Handling Challenges and Deviations (Special Pattern for §2.X)

When reporting challenges within a subsection, use this EXACT rhetorical sequence:

```
PARAGRAPH: Challenge Introduction
"There were several major challenges encountered by the team related to [activity]."

PARAGRAPH: Challenge Details (one sentence per challenge)
"The first was [issue], which [specific consequence]. Another was [issue]. [Impact detail]."

PARAGRAPH: Positive Verdict + Annex Reference (if applicable)
"Overall, however, the [activity] was deemed to be a success. We have also published 
a [related output] about this (refer to Annex [X])."
```

**Rules:**
- Challenges are reported WITHIN the relevant §2.X section, NOT in a separate section
- Challenges ALWAYS end with a positive overall verdict
- NEVER frame as failures — always frame as obstacles managed

### Figure Placement Rules

- Figures appear AFTER the prose paragraph that introduces them
- Caption goes BELOW the figure, centered, in italics:
  ```
  Figure N. [Descriptive Title]
  ```
- Figures are introduced in prose with: "The table below summarizes..." or "...followed by a timeline illustrating..."
- Figure numbering is sequential across the entire document

Continued follow-ups will be undertaken to improve coverage across HEIs, SUCs, and RDIs and to ensure adequate representation by institution type and role. Completing this step is critical to strengthening the evidence base for competency extraction and to ensuring that the subsequent framework draft reflects ecosystem-wide realities."

> "● **Key Informant Interviews (KIIs):** To ensure the framework is market-responsive, the team will commence KIIs with downstream innovation stakeholders, including representatives from industry associations, investors, startups, and MSMEs. This activity targets a 5% weight completion."

**Rules:**
- Each bullet has a **bold title** followed by a colon, then description
- Include month targets: "The immediate priority for Months [X] is to..."
- Include DOST weight targets when applicable: "This activity targets a [X]% weight completion."
- Include dependency language: "Completing this step is critical to..."
- Include recovery language if applicable: "This activity is critical to recover the slight timeline variance incurred during..."
- Typically 3–6 bullets. Never fewer than 3, rarely more than 6.
