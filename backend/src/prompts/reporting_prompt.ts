If a task is not explicitly marked as 'Done' in the dashboard data, it must be reported as ongoing/planned. Do NOT claim it is finished.\r\n8. The final report must be a finished product. Do NOT insert placeholders like [DATA NEEDED] or [Insert XYZ here]. Maximize the available data to produce the best reading-ready narrative possible.\r\n9.
